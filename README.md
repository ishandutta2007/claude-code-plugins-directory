A community-driven, universal repository for code plugins compatible with Anthropic's Claude. This project is inspired by the [official Claude plugins repository](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official) but aims to be a broader, community-curated collection of tools.

## About This Project

The goal of this directory is to provide a central place for the community to discover, share, and contribute Claude-compatible code plugins. Whether you've built a plugin for a niche use case, a popular developer tool, or anything in between, this is the place to share it.

## Plugin Directory

This section will be populated with plugins submitted by the community. Plugins will be organized and reviewed to ensure they meet basic standards of quality and safety.

| Plugin Name | Description | Author | Link |
| :---------- | :---------- | :----- | :--- |
| *Example Plugin* | *A brief description of what this plugin does.* | *@username* | *[Link to repo]() |
